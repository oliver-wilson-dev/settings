Settings for any mac that I want to use

## manual steps:
You should have some settings files downloaded into the `~/mac-setup-files` directory.

### iTerm2:
Open `iTerm2` and go to `Preferences -> General -> Load preferences from a custom folder or URL`. Select, `~/mac-setup-files/iterm2/iterm2-profile.plist`. This will give you some useful key bindings e.g. jump to start/end of line, skip words using alt+arrow keys.

Go to `Preferences -> Profiles -> Colors -> Color Presets -> Import...` and select `~/mac-setup-files/iterm2/iterm2-color-preset.itermcolors`. Then select the `iterm2-color-preset` option from the presets.
